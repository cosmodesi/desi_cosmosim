## DESI cosmological simulation working group
We collect all the codes that has been used by the desi cosmology simulation working group.

To add your code here, please contact Chia-Hsun Chuang (Albert) (chuangch@stanford.edu).

Most of the codes were added using subtree with a update.sh script. Those codes should have its own git reop before being added into this repo. The same script can be used to pull the updates or different version of the code (use tag or release). To update a code in this repo, please contact the maneger of this repo.

Note: when adding a new code, "git checkout master" needs to be executed before "bash /path-of-the-code/update.sh tag-version" even you are on master already.
