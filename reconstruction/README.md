This folder includes the reconstruction codes and analysing tools for the DESI projects.
To include a code from another repo, one should 

1) create a new subfolder under this folder with a README.md file

2) create a new update.sh for adding/updating the new repo

3) use the update.sh script (using subtree) to add the other repo into the new subfolder
